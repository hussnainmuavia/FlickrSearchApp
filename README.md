# Photo Search Application

# A small test app that makes use of the Flickr API

# Android MVVM Architecture With jetpack Compose

## Application Overview

### Assignment Requirements:

The app should display a search field and a button. When the user inputs a search string and presses
the search button the resulting images should be displayed in a List.

* Use this "https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html" API to load the items
* NOTE : Please place API Key in your local.properties file as a constant FLICKER_API_KEY. e.g FLICKER_API_KEY=5a*************c3
* I did this intentionally to demonstrate the mechanism to secure API keys and credentials if place locally.
